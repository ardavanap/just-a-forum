## justAForum Web Application

This is the first website I’ve built, and to make it more challenging, I tried to add more features.  
So, although it was supposed to be a simple forum, I added a blog section as well, which is quite similar.

The website’s front-end is very simple and a bit problematic because it was designed by AI.

### Future Updates

Because the website is large and feature-rich, and due to limited time, many features are incomplete or missing. Some planned updates include:

- Add loggers  
- Add sanitizers  
- Add the ability to view other users’ profiles  
- Enable image upload and display in different sections  
- Prevent activity for restricted users  
- Suspend any comment, blog, etc., containing inappropriate words  
- Add tags to each blog  
- Allow users to delete their own blogs, questions, or comments
